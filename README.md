## Aseprite Lualib
A fork of [RampantDespair's excellent library](https://github.com/RampantDespair/Aseprite-Library).

This fork serves to provide a lightweight install script wrapper for unix systems and to provide a stable, controlled codebase for my neovim plugins. Attribution and credit for the actual lua library goes to RampantDespair.
